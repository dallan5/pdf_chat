First iteration:
    Feedback:
        Stopped using it after a while because it got annoying having to select parts of the text and "save to memory".
        Also, the formatting is really tiring for the eyes and it gets really hard to read the text compated to the pdf. 

        Also, seems like there are some bug that doesn't clear the memory properly. 
        I think the clear memory should be a complete "reset" of the chatbot instead of clearing memory.
        It's to arbitrary

    Utopia:
        After PDF is open, I have a set of pre-existing questions that I can choose from.
        the chatbot unietively understands the context from my current page. 
        Theese questions could be:
            - What is this text about?
            - Write me some questions about this text?
            - Could you exaplain more simply?
